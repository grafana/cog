# Releasing `grafana-foundation-sdk`

Releases to [`grafana-foundation-sdk`](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-foundation-sdk/) are handled by the `./scripts/release-version.sh` script.

## Requirements

* [`go`](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) (GitHub CLI), with authentication configured using `gh auth login`

## Usage

Before releasing, ensure that the `main` branch is checked out and up-to-date:

```console
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

Then, start a dry-run release for the desired version of the schemas:

```console
./scripts/release-version.sh v10.2.x
```

This will perform the release process without pushing any change to give a safe opportunity to review the release.
Details on where to find the generated code and inspect it will be written to the standard output.

If everything looks good, proceed for real:

```console
DRY_RUN=no ./scripts/release-version.sh v10.2.x
```

Disabling dry-run will allow the script to push changes to a *release preview branch* and open a pull-request onto the
actual *release branch*. To finalise the release, review this PR and merge it.

## Options

The following environment variables can be used to alter the behavior of the release script:

* `DRY_RUN`: flag indicating whether the release should actually be published or not â€“ **dry-run is ON by default**.
* `LOG_LEVEL`: number indicating how verbose the script should be. 7 = debug -> 0 = emergency, defaults to 6.
* `COG_CMD`: command used to run `cog`.
* `GH_CLI_CMD`: command used to run `gh` (GitHub CLI).
* `KIND_REGISTRY_PATH`: path to the `kind-registry` repository. If it doesn't exist, the [`kind-registry`](https://github.com/grafana/kind-registry/) will be cloned at that path.
* `FOUNDATION_SDK_PATH`: path to the `grafana-foundation-sdk` repository. If it doesn't exist, the [`grafana-foundation-sdk`](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-foundation-sdk/) will be cloned at that path.
