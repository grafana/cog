# Releasing `cog`

Releases are handled by `goreleaser`, configured in the
[`.goreleaser.yaml`](../.goreleaser.yaml) file and running in the
[`release.yaml`](../.github/workflows/release.yaml) GitHub action.

Trigger the release pipeline by creating and pushing a tag: `git tag v{version} && git push origin v{version}`
