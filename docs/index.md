# Cog

`cog` is a **Co**de **g**enerator created with the following objectives in mind:

* Support multiple schema formats: [CUE](https://cuelang.org/), [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), ...
* Generate code in a wide range of languages: Golang, Java, PHP, Python, Typescript, â€¦
* Generate *types* described by schemas
* Generate developer-friendly *builder libraries*, allowing the creation of complex objects as-code

## Example use-cases

* The [Grafana Foundation SDK](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-foundation-sdk/)
  is fully generated by `cog`, from a collection of schemas exposed by Grafana
* Grafana itself uses `cog` to enable a *schema-first* approach where some
  resources (example: [dashboards](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/packages/grafana-schema/src/schema/dashboard/v2alpha0/dashboard.schema.cue))
  are schematized first, then code is generated both for the frontend and
  backend from those schemas.
* The [`grafana-app-sdk`](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-app-sdk) uses `cog`
  as a library for some of its code generation needs.

!!! tip

    While `cog` is built and maintained by Grafana Labs, it is **completely schema-agnostic**.

## Usage

=== "As a CLI"

    Download the `cog` binary from our [releases](https://github.com/grafana/cog/releases),
    and run the [codegen pipeline](./pipelines/):

    ```console
    cog generate --config ./cog-pipeline.yaml
    ```

=== "As a Go Library"

    See the [Go documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grafana/cog) for more example and a complete API reference.

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "context"
        "fmt"

	    "github.com/grafana/cog"
    )

    func main() {
        files, err := cog.TypesFromSchema().
            CUEModule("/path/to/cue/module").
            SchemaTransformations(
                cog.AppendCommentToObjects("Transformed by cog."),
                cog.PrefixObjectsNames("Example"),
            ).
            Golang(cog.GoConfig{}).
            Run(context.Background())
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }

        if len(files) != 1 {
            panic("expected a single file :(")
        }

        fmt.Println(string(files[0].Data))
    }
    ```

## Maturity

Cog should be considered as "public preview". While it is used by Grafana Labs in production, it still is under active development.
