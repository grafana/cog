# Cog

`cog` is a CLI tool to generate code from schemas.

## Goals

* Support common schema formats: [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), ...
* Generate code in a wide range of languages: Golang, Typescript, Java, ...
* Generate *types* described by schemas
* Generate developer-friendly *builder libraries*, allowing the creation of complex Grafana-related objects as-code

## Maturity

The Grafana Foundation SDK should be considered as "public preview". While it is used by Grafana Labs in production, it still is under active development.
