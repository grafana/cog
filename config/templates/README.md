# Template veneers

The templates contained in this folder are used to customize the types and builders generated by cog.
For example, to automatically position panels on the grid whenever they're added to a dashboard.

To achieve that, cog looks for [template blocks](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#example-Template-Block) following
a particular naming convention, and renders them.

For types, the following blocks are supported:

* `object_{{ Package }}_{{ ObjectName }}_custom_methods`: will be rendered after an object.

For builders, the following blocks are supported:

* `pre_assignment_{{ BuilderName }}_{{ OptionName }}`: will be rendered within an option, before the assignment.
* `post_assignment_{{ BuilderName }}_{{ OptionName }}`: will be rendered within an option, after the assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> The `BuilderName` and `OptionName` components of block names are **case-sensitive**.
