# Template veneers

The templates contained in this folder are used to customize the builders generated by cog.
For example, to automatically position panels on the grid whenever they're added to a dashboard.

To achieve that, cog looks for [template blocks](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#example-Template-Block) following
a particular naming convention, and renders them.

The following blocks are supported:

* `pre_assignment_{{ BuilderName }}_{{ OptionName }}`: will be rendered within an option, before the assignment.
* `post_assignment_{{ BuilderName }}_{{ OptionName }}`: will be rendered within an option, after the assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> The `BuilderName` and `OptionName` components of block names are **case-sensitive**.
